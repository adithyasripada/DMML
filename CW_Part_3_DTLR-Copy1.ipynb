    "The dataset I have chosen (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) contains the listing information of Airbnb’s in the city of Seattle. After having a look at this dataset, I wanted to study it in further detail and see what I could find from it. Which is what I will be doing in this coursework. The data was compiled together on the 25th of September 2021, meaning I will be working with up-to-date data. Originally found this dataset on Kaggle but found a newer version of this data from the original source which was given in Kaggle. When looking for a dataset I had a dilemma choosing between this or another dataset. The reason being this dataset has 4000 instances and 74 Attributes while the other one had 10000 instances but only 9 attributes (so I was unsure which would be more important more rows or more columns). After some thought and help from the lab helper I felt that more columns would mean I would be able to find more features from the data and be able to find some more interesting patterns and trends from the data.

Since the model is trained on training data it is likely to overestimate accuracy scores on training data. This is why always true accuracy of a classifier is estimated on unseen test data."
